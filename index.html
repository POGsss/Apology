                    <p>Hi Lovey, I know I've already hurt you so much, and I dont want to cause you anymore pain. Gusto ko lang sabihin na I'm really sorryyy for everything, sorrry for not showing you enough effort, sorry for making you feel neglected, and sorry for all the times I failed you. Diko mean na saktan ka in anyway but I know my actions did and super nagreregret me everytime naiisip ko sya.</p>

                   <p>You've always been so patient with me, kahit madalas me wala, kahit minsan di kita nabibigyan ng enough time. I know pinipilit mong intindihin ako even though nasasaktan na ikaw. You even gaslight yourself just to adjust with my shortcomings. And that hurts me, knowing na napapabayaan kita and diko naaalagaan yung relationship natin the way I should have.</p>

                   <p>Ang sakit isipin na the person I Iove the most is the same person I ended up hurting. I hate that I made you feel unimportant when in reality you are one of the most important people in my life. Sorryy for making you feel that way, sorrry for letting you feel na you're not my priority. I know you felt angry and disappointed because dimo feel na nageeffort ako but I'm sorry loveyy.</p>

                   <p>To be honest, I felt pressured and overwhelmed, not because I dont want to fix us or make any efforts, but because everything happened so fast. Yung problems natin, my responsibility, school works, and other things all piled up at the same time and yung mind ko di nya macomprehend yung mga yun ng sabay sabay. And I struggled to find the right way to fix things between us.</p>

                    <p>But please believe me when I say that I wanted to fix things, diko man na show agad na nageeffort me but I really do. I never wanted to lose you loveeyy and I hate that my lack of actions made it seem like I didn't care. But in reality, I really do care loveyy, I care about you more than anything. I just wasn't able to handle everything properly and Im really sorryyy for that loveeyy.</p>

                    <p>I dont want to make this sound like Im making excuses. Inaamin ko naman na I really fell short, that I should have done better, and my struggles shouldn't be a reason para ipafeel sayo na dika important. Mali ko yun loveyyy and lagi ko syang nipagsisisihan. Just know that Im willing to change, to do better, and to learn how to show my love in a way that you truly deserves.</p>

If there's even the slightest chance na pwede pa nating ayusin to, I'll hold onto it. And if ever that time comes, I promise, I will do everything to make things right, Im gonna do everything to prove you that I can be better. Im really sorryyy again loveyy :((</p>
